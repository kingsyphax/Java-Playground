# Java Playground
A quick way to run bits of Java code, made with Python

This script is made especially useful by this line in my .bashrc: alias jpg="python /Users/npward/Dropbox/Random/Java\ Playground/run.py"

Now, by typing "jpg" into the Terminal, I am immediately given a Java prompt. This works, in theory, like the Python interpreter: I can type bits of Java code, whether one line or multiple, and see the results. When a line lacks a terminal semicolon, the Playground (like the Python interpreter) attempts to output its value; for instance, typing "4+9" prints the result of that calculation, 13.
